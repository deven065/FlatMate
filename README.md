# FlatMate ‚Äî Society Maintenance Management (Admin)

FlatMate is a modern React + Tailwind CSS web app that helps housing societies manage members, maintenance charges, payments, receipts, and monthly dues. It uses Firebase (Auth + Realtime Database) for authentication and data storage and runs on Vite for a fast developer experience.

---

## üöÄ Local Setup

1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deven065/FlatMate.git
cd FlatMate
npm install
```

2) Configure environment variables

- Create a .env or .env.local file at the project root using .env.example as a guide:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

3) Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Vite will print the local URL (for example, [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173); the port may vary).

4) Build and preview (optional)

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## üîß Configuration Details

Tailwind v4

- vite.config.js adds the Tailwind Vite plugin:

```js
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({ plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()] })
```

- postcss.config.js uses the Tailwind PostCSS plugin:

```js
export default { plugins: { '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}, autoprefixer: {} } }
```

- src/index.css imports Tailwind:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

Firebase

- Firebase config is read from Vite env variables in src/firebase.js
- Realtime DB must have the correct databaseURL (region-specific)
- Auth uses email/password for admin/member accounts

Data model (Realtime Database)

- users/{uid}
  - fullName, flatNumber, email, role: "member" | "admin", dues, paid, status, createdAt
- members/{id} (legacy; still readable)
- recentPayments/{id}
  - member, flat, email, amount, method, date (YYYY-MM-DD), receipt, createdAt
- config/maintenance
  - maintenanceCharge, waterCharge, sinkingFund, lateFee, dueDate

---

## üóÇÔ∏è App Structure (high-level)

- src/Components/Admin
  - MemberTable: manage members, receive payments, pending summary/export
  - RecentPayments: searchable/filterable list of payments with export
  - MaintenanceConfigForm: configure charges and bulk update dues
  - Other dashboard UI parts (Header, Footer, Stats, etc.)
- src/Components/Member
  - MemberDashboard + PayModal (member view)
- src/Components/Toast
  - ToastProvider + useToast (global toasts)
- src/utils/receipt.js
  - openReceiptPrintWindow(payment, profile)

---

## ÔøΩ Usage Guide (Admin)

Member Management

- Add Member: creates a Firebase Auth user and a users/{uid} profile
- Edit: change name, flat, email, status; adjust Pending (dues) manually if needed
- Receive Payment: simple modal to take amount and method
  - Auto-updates Paid and Pending, logs a record in recentPayments, and opens a printable receipt
- Top summary: Total Members, Members with Pending, Total Pending
- Only Pending toggle: quickly focus on defaulters
- Export: downloads a CSV of the current view (applies search and filters)

Recent Payments

- Live list ordered by createdAt/date
- Search by name/flat/email/receipt
- Filter by method and date range
- Summary tiles (count + total)
- Export filtered CSV
- View: opens printable receipt window; Download: quick PDF via jsPDF

Maintenance Config

- Save charges under config/maintenance
- Optionally adds the total charge to member dues in both legacy and unified nodes

## üîí Security & App Check

- Never commit .env files or API keys
- Restrict Realtime Database rules for production (dev rules can be permissive; tighten for prod)
- Consider role-based checks (admin vs member) in the UI and rules

### Firebase App Check (reCAPTCHA v3)

App Check protects Firebase APIs (Storage, Realtime DB, etc.) by verifying requests come from your app.

1) In Firebase Console ‚Üí Build ‚Üí App Check ‚Üí Register app
  - Choose your Web App
  - Provider: reCAPTCHA v3
  - Copy the Site Key
  - Add these to `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_APPCHECK_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_v3_site_key
# Optional for local dev; set to 'true' to generate a random debug token printed in the console
VITE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=true
```

2) Domains
  - Add your local and deployed domains in App Check: e.g. `http://localhost:5173` and your production domain

3) Enforcement
  - Start in Monitoring mode. After you see verified traffic for Storage/Database, enable Enforcement

4) Code
  - `src/firebase.js` initializes App Check with `ReCaptchaV3Provider` and auto-refresh. It reads the env vars above.

5) Verify
  - App Check ‚Üí APIs table should show some % of Verified requests for Storage/Realtime DB when you use the app
  - Network tab ‚Üí look for `x-firebase-appcheck` header in requests

### Storage rules (notices)

For file uploads used by the Admin ‚ÄúNotices‚Äù feature, use Storage rules that allow authenticated writes to `notices/` and public reads if required by your use case. Example:

```js
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
   function isSignedIn() { return request.auth != null; }
   function isNotice() { return request.resource.name.matches('notices/.*'); }

   // Public read of notices; adjust to your needs
   match /notices/{fileName} {
    allow read: if true; // or isSignedIn();
    allow write: if isSignedIn() &&
      request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 &&
      request.resource.contentType.matches('application/.*|image/.*|text/plain|application/pdf');
   }

   // Default deny
   match /{allPaths=**} {
    allow read, write: if false;
   }
  }
}
```

If you need admin-only writes, add a custom claim to admin users (e.g., `admin: true`) and change `allow write` to `isSignedIn() && request.auth.token.admin == true && ...`.

Tip: If uploads stall at 0%, validate that App Check is registered and Storage rules permit the path and content-type. Our upload UI will auto-retry once and then surface errors.

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting

White screen or analytics error

- Ensure VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID is set if using analytics
- If problems persist, temporarily disable analytics in src/firebase.js by commenting out getAnalytics(app)

Tailwind PostCSS plugin error

- Ensure @tailwindcss/postcss is installed and present in postcss.config.js
- Reinstall deps and restart Vite:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Realtime Database URL

- Use the region-specific URL (for example, [https://PROJECT_ID-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app](https://PROJECT_ID-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app))

Permissions / Rules

- In development, you can use relaxed rules. For production, lock down read/write access.
